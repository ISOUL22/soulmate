# Soulmate 💞

Soulmate is an addon for [Natsumi Browser](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/natsumi-browser) that aims to complement Natsumi with more customisation in the form of various small tweaks across the browser experience such as:
1. **The main change that Soulmate brings is the option of the Catppuccin Mocha color pallette across the browser!**
2. Smaller compact mode 🦋
3. Compact extensions menu
   1. Gray-scale pinned extension icons
4. Trafficlight style window controls
5. Catppuccin in browser pages
6. URL bar tweaks
   1. Hide certain urlbar icons
   2. Hide back and forward buttons
7. Tab animations
8. Fade out unloaded tabs

*Tweaks marked with a 🦋 require **Natsumi** to work*
